        <h1>Intership</h1>
        <p>Michael's Mission Hospital is a certified teaching hospital accredited by the Medical Practicioners and Dentist Board, the Board for Medicine and Clinical Medicine, and the Clinical Officers Council.
        </p>
         <P>
          Each year Michael's accepts eight Medical Officer Interns as well as eight Clinical Officer Interns. We hope to begin accepting more Interns starting in 2016.  Interns complete one year of training including four three-month rotations in Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery and Obstetrics. They are challenged with increasing patient care responsibilities under the supervision of Residents (where applicable) and Attending Physicians, as they continue to hone their knowledge by leading case discussions, M&M reports and patient admission topics.

        <h1>Doctors' money</h1>
        <p>Kenyan doctors have gone on innumerable strikes over salary woes, while their counterparts in Canada are unhappy about getting a pay rise. It is almost unheard of that a worker would complain of a high salary from their employer. If anything the search for better payment is one of the main reasons people are always hunting for new jobs. Over 700 doctors in Quebec, Canada have protested against their own pay rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctors have asked the Government to spend the money on patient care and resources for their underpaid and overworked colleagues instead. In an open letter to the public published on February, the medical practitioners noted that, “The only thing that seems to be immune to cuts is our salary.” Part of the deal constitutes that Quebec’s 10,000 medical specialists will see their annual salary rise from $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.4 per cent each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data compiled by the Canadian Institute of Health Information shows that on average, specialists in the province earn $403,537 Canadian (Sh31.56m) annually. A physician is paid $339,000 (Sh26.52m) for clinical services by the government's Ministry of Health. A family physician earns $275,000 (Sh21.51m) for clinical services and a surgical specialist is paid $461,000 (Sh36.06m) per year on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, doctors in Kenya downed their tools for more than three months decrying poor facilities in hospitals, working conditions and allowances. “We deeply sympathise with the unfortunate plight of these highly esteemed professionals who have had to endure as they wait for their allowances,” Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) Secretary General Ouma Oluga said. They also complained that the Government did not honour the 2013 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which would also see them earning better salaries and a have a better deployment system in place for the doctors. KMPDU signed an agreement with the Government in March 2017, ending the longest strike by doctors in Kenyan history.

        <h1>Patient Speaks</h1>
        <p>“I’m feeling much better now as compared to the time when I was first brought into the facility,” said the patient who had blood clots in the brain.</p>
        <p>According to him, he developed the complications after he was knocked down by a motorbike a few metres from his Kahawa West residence.</p>
        <p>I was crossing the road at around 7pm when a speeding motorbike hit me. The impact left me unconscious,” he said.</p>
        <p>The patient said he was taken to a nearby clinic by Good Samaritans where he spent the night.

          Family members who visited him at the clinic took him to another hospital in Kasarani, St Francis Hospital, from where he was taken to KNH.

          He said doctors at KNH recommended he undergoes surgery.

          He was to spend a night at the country’s largest referral facility awaiting surgery, which unfortunately never happened only to hear from relatives that someone else had been wrongly operated on.

          “I didn’t even see the other patient and cannot recognise him since we’ve not officially met since the mishap occurred,” said the patient, who does several jobs on contract for a living.</p>

              He said doctors had opted to prescribe medication instead of operating on him.

              On the other hand, the other patient, who was mistakenly operated on, said he was recovering.

            “I’m feeling better, although there is slight pain from the post-operative wounds,” he said.</p>

        <h1>Ebola in Africa</h1>
        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 27,000 people have contracted Ebola since December 2013, of which more than 11,000 have died. Symptoms include bleeding from multiple orifices, severe weight loss and red eyes. There is currently no cure.
        The vast majority of victims are from the three countries at the center of the epidemic, namely, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Thirty news cases were reported in total in these countries in the week to July 12, 2015, with Sierra Leone posting a one-month high of 14 new sufferers, according to the WHO.

                  Ebola: A survivor's story Ebola: A survivor's story  
        11:11 AM ET Tue, 21 July 2015 | 03:50
        Ebola briefly returned to the headlines this week with a scare at a hospital in New York, but the deadly virus continues to claim victims in West Africa, dealing a devastating social and economic blow to some of the world's poorest countries.

        However, the epidemic, which is now in its second year, has also highlighted the surprising resilience of other nations in the region.

        "The public is not always aware of what's happening in West Africa, but we're still seeing 20 to 30 new cases of the disease in Sierra Leone and Guinea every week and Liberia had a resurgence recently," Kent Brantly, an American doctor who survived Ebola after contracting it from patients in West Africa, told CNBC on Tuesday.

        Although the epidemic has waned from its peak at the end of last year, when hundreds of new cases were diagnosed every week, it has so far proved impossible to eradicate completely. Concerns exist that the epidemic may never be fully eliminated.

        "What we really learnt from this is that the healthcare apparatus, particularly in the most affected countries was very poor and unprepared and unready to cope," Charles Laurie, head of Africa at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft in the U.K., told CNBC.
        Notably, Ebola reappeared in Liberia at the end of June, with six cases reported in the two weeks to July 12—even though the WHO designated the country free from the epidemic in May.

        <h1>Ebola Control</h1>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following preventive measures for people in an area affected by an outbreak:</p>
        <p>Practice careful hygiene (e.g., wash hands with soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, or chlorine solution)</p>
        <p>Avoid direct contact with bodies of people who have died from confirmed or suspected infection. During epidemics, direct contact with any dead body should be avoided</p>
        <p> Doffing: removal of used PPE is a high-risk process that requires a structured procedure, a trained observer, and a designated area for removal to ensure protection. PPE must be removed slowly and deliberately in the correct sequence to reduce the possibility of self-contamination or other exposure. A stepwise process should be developed and used during training and daily practice.</p>
        <p>If infection is suspected based on initial screening, immediate isolation is warranted before any further workup is carried out. This is crucial to reduce contact with other patients and healthcare workers while the patient is being investigated. Isolation measures should be continued until the patient has tested negative.</p>
        <p>Do not handle items that have come into contact with an infected person's body fluids (e.g., clothes, medical equipment, needles)</p>
        <p>Returning travelers (including healthcare workers) should follow local policies for surveillance and monitor their health for 21 days and seek medical attention if symptoms develop, especially fever.</p>
        <p>Avoid funeral or burial rituals that require handling of the body of someone who has died from confirmed or suspected Ebola virus infection</p>

        <h1>Drugs Scandal</h1>
        <p>he families of those who died at the Gosport War Memorial hospital in the 1990s said they had finally been believed after two decades of campaigning, but pledged to continue to fight for criminal prosecutions not only for the doctor who prescribed the drugs but also others who knew and failed to stop the practice.

          Gosport hospital deaths: families condemn 'scandalous' failings
          “This is the beginning of another journey,” said Ann Reeves, whose mother Elsie Devine, 88, was one of those who died. “It was quite a shock – for the first time somebody telling me what I knew 18 years ago. I want the people responsible for the deaths of our loved ones. We want them back in the criminal court. That’s the way it should go.”
        </P>
        <p>
          Speaking in the House of Commons, Hunt said the police, working with the Crown Prosecution Service and clinicians, would consider whether criminal charges should be brought and suggested that Hampshire constabulary should consider whether the investigation should be conducted by another force given its “vested interest”.
        </p>
        <p>
        The report, led by the former bishop of Liverpool James Jones, who ran the Hillsborough inquiry, said the home secretary, attorney general and Hampshire police should all “recognise the significance” of the review findings. It looked at 1,500 deaths at the hospital and found that 456 followed inappropriate administration of opioid drugs and a possible 200 more patients had their lives shortened.</p>
