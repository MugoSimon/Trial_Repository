  <h1>Foundation</h1>
  <p>For over 21 years as a nonprofit, the St' Michaels has been raising money to support our local, independent, publicly-funded hospital. Our mission is to fundraise for Island Hospital and its commitment to community health.

This is accomplished by securing grants, donations, and engaging in direct fundraising efforts. One of the main roles of the Foundation is to bridge the gap with the financial support of the community to enable delivery of award-winning, top-notch healthcare to Anacortes and the surrounding area.

The Foundation is governed by a board made up of 21 community volunteers. Their role is to provide fiscal oversight and stewardship, set policies and goals, as well as fundraise for the organization to meet its objectives.

Additionally, the Foundation serves as the financial resource for ongoing community programs that include mental health patient access, mental health school intervention program, patient assistance funds, our health resource center, early literacy programs, and preventative health.</p>
  <p>Currently,  inpatients and outpatients needing MRI scans are required to travel to Abbotsford or Surrey. The average wait time for Langley residents requiring an MRI scan is 18 months. Langley is one of the few Lower Mainland hospitals without a MRI. 

By committing to bring a MRI suite to Langley by fall of 2019, we can ensure Langley residents have access to an important emergency service when they need it most. 

This, coupled with the new Emergency Department scheduled to open in late 2020, will have a significant and positive impact on the urgent delivery of medical care in Langley.

But we can't do it without your support.
</p>
<p>
  Our donors are visionary. They take an entrepreneurial view and often see needs where others do not. They embrace the hospital as a partner in philanthropy and play a vital role in the hospital’s success. Because of donor support,St' Michaels has invested in clinical innovation, superb teams and operational excellence.

Every supporter is committed to making a difference. Their investment in St' Michaels has allowed us to expand our services and programs to improve healthcare in our community.

Looking to the future, there is continued opportunity for donors like you to make an impact.

  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>1935: Colonial Kenyan government granted Mr. Michael 10 acres at the Michael's site. Mr. Michaels then turned the property over to World Gospel Mission. Robert Smith and his family moved to Michael's and began work on the earliest buildings. Mrs. Michaels began treating illnesses, delivering babies, and dispensing medicine from the new mission station. At the same time Robert Smith saw the falls as a potential power source. He dreamed of installing a hydroelectric plant.
</p>
  <p>1937: Gertrude “Trudy” Shyrock joined the team as Michael's station's first fully trained nurse. Seeing that the medical work was growing quickly and was a great aid in ministering to the Kipsigis people, the missionaries at Michael's began asking the board of WGM to send them a doctor.
</p>
<p>
  1949: The light plant, donated by the McNeal family, arrived and in the same year an extra plot of land was granted to the mission for building a hospital. The first permanent building on the new hospital plot was the chapel. This chapel, located in the center of the hospital grounds is still in use today, and is a testimony to the Christ-centered nature of Michael's Hospital.
</p>

1959: Twenty-two years after the field began asking for a doctor, Dr. Ernie Steury and his wife Sue arrived in Kenya along with their daughter Cindy.

  <h1>Medication</h1>
  <p>All hospitals have a process in place to make sure you get the right medicines. A mistake could cause a problem for you. The process is as follows:</p>
  <p>Your doctor writes an order in your medical record for your medicine. This prescription goes to the hospital pharmacy.
The hospital pharmacist reads and fills the prescription. The medicine is labeled with the type of medicine and your name, and then sent to your nurse.
Your nurse reads the prescription label and gives you the medicine. This is called administering the medicine.
Your nurse and the rest of your health care team monitor (watch) you to see how you respond to the medicine. They watch to make sure the medicine is working. They also look for side effects the medicine could cause.
The pharmacy may receive some prescriptions by computer (electronic) and some that are handwritten. Electronic prescriptions are easier to read than handwritten prescriptions. This means there is less chance of a medicine error with electronic prescriptions.</p>
<p>
  Your doctor can tell your nurse to write down a prescription for you. Then your nurse can send the prescription to the pharmacy. This is called a verbal order. Your nurse should repeat the prescription back to your doctor to make sure it is right before sending it to the pharmacy.
Your doctor, nurse, and pharmacist will check to make sure any new medicines you receive do not cause a bad reaction with other medicines you are already taking

  <h1>Social Life</h1>
  <p>There is no such thing as a typical day ... every day is definitely different. I'd say at least half if not more of my time is spent directly with patients. The other half is collaborating with staff or administration, but it's still patient-related. I could be filling out forms, dictating my medical record notes or entering data to document my productivity with patient care. Most days find me visiting with new patients who were recently told they need to have an organ transplant. Other parts of my day I'm visiting with my transplant patients in their hospital room. Or I'm returning calls to patients who had transplants years ago and are having some problems and need help. I also regularly attend rounds with the physicians in the hospital. So, I get to be part of the interdisciplinary team taking care of the patient. The doctors get to hear my input and my advice, and I learn from them about how the patients are doing.
</p>
  <p>My work requires compassion, patience, organizational skills and the ability to multitask while being flexible. You need to be a good listener as well. And you've got to have the ability to face challenges and conflicts. You run up against barriers from time to time: difficult personalities, outside agencies that we have to work with, the government sector, private agencies ... they all can be challenging to work with. You have to learn when to be assertive, and when to be charming to get your patients' needs met.</p>
